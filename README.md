# CasAnn
Targeted Identification of CRISPR Associated Gene Operons from Next Generation Sequences

This software provides targeted assembly of cas genes and gene operons from Next Generation Sequencing. Rather than requiring full assembly of transcripts, metagenomes or genomic material. CasAnn targets and annotates only the regions of interest to Cas researchers. Since full cas operons are able to be assembled this opens the possibility of identifying new cas associated proteins within existing sequencing runs.
